# Yolo-Spammer
Coded this for fun based off of a HTTP request that I sniffed a almost a year ago, now open sourcing it.

I was the first to code an official YOLO Spammer, it was published on YouTube but then taken down by several copyright strikes.
I have seen new repositories that are copies of my code, you can check the .rar that I have included and verify that I was the first one to code it as it was last edited on 11/10/2019

The program was free to use and a download was placed however, the protected code (to prevent cracking and reselling) was marked as a virus (false-positive) so I have went ahead and open sourced it here.

It's very simple, coded it in 10-15 minutes whilst others were selling a copy for $20 (insane).

Enjoy and I hope YOLO learns and adds some type of CSRF token protection to check requests origin!
